# CrafText!

### My Goal -
Struggling to sleep one night, I decided to open up notes on my phone, jotting down notes on my next potential project after 'finishing' my last project "First Jump". I settled on the idea of creating a game, trying to use loops like I did in First Jump, but without the Pygame module. Developing the idea of creating a text-based crafting game using loops and checking player input with if statements.
